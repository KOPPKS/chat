This is a simple chatroom that employs $http get and post requests to allow the user, or users depending on who else is logged into the same API, to enter text and then see it in the general area of the chatroom.

In the controller, I have a getParseData function and a postData function, which are placed on $scope.

When multiple people run the application, they will be able to chat as if in a regular instant messaging system, with each person being able to see the other's response after they have entered it.

This app was built to simply practice running both GET and POST API functions together with the same data.
